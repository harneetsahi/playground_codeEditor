# A simple code editor using CodeMirror v6

It's a bare bones code editor, created to experiment with the custom context menu functionality.
You are still able to access the browser default context menu.
If you press shift when right clicking inside the editor, it gives you access to the custom context menu.

It does not include any other functionality.
